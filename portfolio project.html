<h2>Designing and Building a Personal Portfolio Website</h2>
<p>To Showcase my learned skills in marketing, content creation, SEO, user research, project planning and website design, I decided to design and build this website. Here is the process involved in the creation of this website.</p>
<h4>Miro Board</h4>
<p>To create a digital portfolio of work I first used Miro to plan out and visualise what I wanted to create for my website. I also looked at what others had included in their portfolio websites and figured out what I felt they did well and improvements they could make. I used this to design how I was going to organise and layout my portfolio website. 
    </p>
<p>I love working with this tool. It is useful for organising your ideas/for group collaboration projects. Another example where I have used Miro is within the 
    <a href="portfolio project.html">Redshift Band project</a> where I used Miro to mind map information gathered from an initial discussion/assesment with the band, over their digital needs</p>

<h4>Building Website</h4>
<p>I decided to create this portfolio in Visual Studio Code to code a unique website for my work. This allows me to continue building and showcasing more advanced digital skills, fully customise my site and create a more unique/professional portfolio. 
    In my planning stages, I reviewed other portfolio/personal websites. I found that those sites built using a website builder (like Wix) were less unique and had layouts that looked less seamlined for the purpose (templates limit how you present your infomation eventhrough they can be a useful time-saver)</p>
<p>In creation of the <a href="https://bumblecreates.github.io/redshiftband/index.html" target="_blank">Redshift Band Home Page</a>, I also used CSS, HTML and JavaScript.
Feedback from the Band suggested that this method of building websites produced a website that better resonated with clients due to the above reasons.</p>
<h4>Canva Designing Banners</h4>
<img src="canvascreenshot.png" alt="Canva Design" width=49% style="float:right;">
<p>Canva was used to design the clickable links to project work. Canva lets you quickly design material in custom sizes. The software provides free image and text designs. For this banner I used my own main photo.
   This is a useful tool for creating marketing marterial within a certain scale. An example of this could be an Instagram post or a slideshow for a YouTube video. Canva was used to create the banners due to the variety of formatting options avaliable when creating visual content. 
</p>
<p>Other projects where I have used Canva includes</p>
<ul>
    <li>To create Redshift marketing carousel material</li>
    <li>For marketing presentations</li>
    <li>To create Pinterest posts for eBay marketing</li>
</ul>

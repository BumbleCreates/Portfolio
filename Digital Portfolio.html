<h2>Digital Portfolio</h2>
<div>

</div>
<div><p>Many of my digital marketing skills were learned through Bath Spa's Click Start course. These were built through helping to manage web content for the Redshift progressive metal band as well as building a custom site for the band based on their requirements. My Master's in Wildlife Conservation (taught by the University West of England and Bristol zoological Society), also allowed me to build skills in creating marketing campaigns and material in relation to Environmental Conservation.</p>
<p>Alongside my accademic studies, I have also participated in various marketing campaigns. These marketing campaignns were for a previous eBay business</p>
<p>As both a creative and analytical individual, I specialise in collaborating with creative individuals to fill analytical/digital skill gaps. I enjoy producing creative and SEO friendly content.</p>

<p>Whilst studying marketing + Digital skills, I was asked by members from the metal band, Redshift to help with marketing material. 
    For this I worked with the band as if they were a client to review current marketing material and create a website in HTML, 
    CSS and JavaScript. 
    I have also created my portfolio website in html and CSS.</p>

    <h2>Mini Projects and Team Tasks</h2>
<h5>Coffee Shop Group Marketing Plan</h5>
<img src="coffee shop market plan.jpg" alt="coffee project" width="100%">
<p>Click Start course - team exercise. We were tasked with designing a marketing campaign for the launch of a theoretical coffee shop. In this task, I organised the ideas of our team to gather ideas for a marketing plan to propose to our client.</p>
<h5>Virtual Reality Gym Marketing Plan</h5>
<p>Click Start Mini Project - In pairs we were tasked with designing a gym and producing a marketing strategy for that gym. 
    It required identifying the target audience and tailoring the product to them, deciding how to market the product 
    (how would this fit the target audience), deciding how to collect information for a clearer idea of the target audience 
    for the product and how to reach them. As well as this the project involved deciding how to monitor success of marketing campaigns + the product.
    To present the project we created this powerpoint presentation - <a href="vr pres final.pdf" target="_blank">VR Gym Presentation</a></p>

<h2>The Redshift Project</h2>
<p>I was asked by the band Redshift to help with their digital marketing and to build a website. I am currently finishing a website for the band which is coded in html,CSS and JavaScript.
    A preview of the website so far can be viewed <a href="https://bumblecreates.github.io/redshiftband/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<h5>Step 1 - Establishing Target Audience and Goals</h5>
<p>The first step I took was to have a semi-structured conversation with the band. Here I asked questions with the aim to establish the bands
    digital marketing pain points, their needs and try to understand their target audience. I took the notes from this session and created a mindmap using Miro.
    This mindmap was useful as a guide for further research such as competition anaylsis and SEO.

<h5>Step 2 - SEO and Competition Analysis</h5>
<p>Now that I had a rough brief to work from, the next step was to understand the competition and the audience for Redshift.</p>
